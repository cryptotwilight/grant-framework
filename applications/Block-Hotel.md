## Project Overview
### Overview
- **Name:** Block Hotel - Hotels Decentralized 
- **Brief Description:** Block Hotel is a decentralized platform built on the EOS blockchain that enables Hotels to convert their room inventory into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These NFTs are configurable, composable and openly tradeable. This allows for the creation of on-chain rule bound travel stays, creation of bespoke travel packages, the use of travel stays in DeFi and the receipt of transfer royalties by hotels, a revenue stream that is not available to Hotels today. The goal of this project will be to fund the creation of a prototype service on the EOS blockchain, with a view to conducting onward initial marketplace trials across the various sections of the Hotel value chain. 
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Block Hotel is a winner at the [EVMxIdeathon](https://evmxideathon.devpost.com/) hosted by Helios (https://www.heliosrising.com/post/evmxideathon-results-and-conclusion). The aim of the Block Hotel is to launch on the EOS Network helping to onboard a large section of the Hotel Travel market into Web3. Block Hotel was also a successful participant in the Helios Seed Incubator (https://www.heliosrising.com/helios-incubator) 
- **Reason for Interest:** Having worked for the likes of Lastminute.com, Expedia and Heathrow Airport, and with several years BUIDLing in Web3 the time is right for this initiative because transformation of the travel industry is a multi-year success story. The interest in EOS is because it has the right blockchain infrastructure and roadmap balance necessary to support a largely conservative industry such as Hotels that naturally operate at Enterprise class computing and beyond.

 - IPFS
Additional technologies will be included as needed 

#### Documentation

#### Block Hotel Proof of Concept Final State
The final state of the Block Hotel - Proof of Concept is the creation of a working on chain PoC on the EOS blockchain. This implementation will be purely technical and will not include some of the additional aspects such as business relationships, community etc. The Proof of Concept will also exclude any commercial implementation guidance e.g. pricing resource management etc. 

The goal will be to create an extensible opensource dApp that can be used by other organisations and individuals  interested in transforming the Hotels industry with blockchain on EOS.
The following products will be delivered: 
- Block Hotel - Hotel Bearer Token minting and provisioning dApp 
- Hotel Bearer Token Marketplace strawman  - this will enable functionality to search for and book a provisioned Hotel Bearer Token

### Ecosystem Fit
- Block Hotel could be classed as part of the Utility, Marketplace and NFT categories of the EOS ecosystem. Block Hotel adds a new dApp category for Travel in the EOS Ecosystem 

**Target Audience**
- Block Hotel's target audience are real world hotels such as independent hotels and hotel chains. Block Hotel's further userbase is Hotel Guests.

**Market Need**
- Block Hotel uses Web3 on EOS to address the growing issues around travel unpredictability.

## Development Status

- Post ideation in 2022, we have begun business feasibility analysis in a bid to understand the shape of the User Experience for Hotels, Travellers and the Hotels value chain. With this we have been able to understand some of the major impediments to the introduction of Web3 and blockchain into the Hotels industry, such as business education. 
- We have also completed Pitch development for the project as part of the Helios Accelerator in 2023
- We are now in the process of engaging the EOS ecosystem to explore joint venture projects to develop supporting market infrastructure such as marketplaces. 


## Development Roadmap

### Milestone Summary

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 10,000 USD

### Milestone 1 â€” Implement EOSIO Block Hotel Proof of Concept Application
In this milestone we will be focused on building the core product, with a view to developing a smooth and highly friendly user experience for Hotels when building and provisioning their inventories. 

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 7,000 USD

| ID | Deliverable | Specification |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a developer can deploy and interact with the Block Hotel contracts on chain. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Article | We will publish an **article** that explains to Hotel users the progress we have achieved as part of this milestone for the grant
| 1. | EOS EVM Compatible smart contracts | We will create EOS EVM Compatible smart contracts that will enable the issuance, transfer and destruction of Hotel Bearer Tokens on EOS |  
| 2. | Front-End / User Interface | We will create a UI that allows a small hotel to provision Hotel Bearer Tokens through a single user |  



### Milestone 2  - PoC Marketplace
In this milestone we will be focused on Marketplace integration. Existing NFT marketplaces do not currently support the needs for travel oriented products as would be found in Web2. Therefore in this milestone we will look to create a marketplace straw man (new build) that sets the principles for Hotel Bearer Token User Experience for travellers on EOS. 

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 3,000 USD

## Future Plans

Post this Proof of Concept the Block Hotel team will look to do the following:
- Further engage EoS Ecosystem participants in the development of supporting infrastructure and in Hotel industry engagement
- Show case the Block Hotel PoC at major travel, hospitality and hotels conferences such as for example:
	- https://www.holidayworldshow.com/
	- https://chain4travel.com/unchained/
	- https://www.fvw.de/events/fvw-kongress-2023-592
- Build a supportive advocate traveller community on social media
- Engage the Hotel Industry value chain partners such as Travel Agents and Online Travel Agents 
- Develop the proof of concept created as part of this grant into a prototype product complete with Hotels and Travelers. 
-
The longer term plans is currently to scale up to a commercial Prototype followed by a business Pilot from which the project can secure it's MVP and subsequently chart a path to scale-up.
